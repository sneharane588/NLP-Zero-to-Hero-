<br>This repo contains NLP programs at from very scratch.

I will keep adding the code file here as I learn something new in NLP.<br/>

  - Tokenization is essentially splitting a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or an entire text document into smaller units, such as individual words or terms. Each of these smaller units are called tokens.
  - Before processing a natural language, we need to identify the words that constitute a string of characters.
  - That’s why tokenization is the most basic step to proceed with NLP (text data).
  - This is important because the meaning of the text could easily be interpreted by analyzing the words present in the text.
  - Consider the below string: <br/>“Sneha likes to walk in a garden.” <br/> After we perform tokenization, We get ['Sneha', 'likes', 'walk', 'in', 'a', 'garden'].
  
  - We can use this tokenized form to:
     - Count the number of words in the text
     - Count the frequency of the word, that is, the number of times a particular word is present
